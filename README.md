Vcrypt is a Web3 decentralized application (dApp) that provides a secure and transparent system for vehicle registration, ownership verification, and transaction tracking, built on the Cardano blockchain.

Unlike traditional centralized systems, Vcrypt leverages blockchain technology to ensure data immutability, tamper resistance, and trustless verification of vehicle ownership. Each vehicle is linked to a unique smart contract, and ownership transfers are processed securely through wallet-signed transactions.

Vcrypt supports role-based access for Admins, Officers, and Vehicle Owners, and integrates AI-powered assistance, document storage via IPFS, and wallet-based authentication (Lace, Eternl). It also includes features like QR code generation, transaction history, night/day modes, and a feedback system to ensure a modern, user-friendly, and inclusive experience.

Whether youâ€™re an authority managing vehicle data, an officer verifying documents, or a citizen owning a vehicle, Vcrypt offers a secure, transparent, and user-centric platform for managing vehicular records in the blockchain era.
